## CSS GRID LAYOUT & FLEX-BOX EDITS

this is my sign-up form which i hav used grid-layout and flex-box instead of CSS FLOATS

....It makes designing web pages easier, without having to use floats and positioning. The CSS Flexbox offers a one-dimensional layout. It is helpful in allocating and aligning the space among items in a container (made of grids). It works with all kinds of display devices and screen sizes

....Flexbox is responsive and mobile-friendly. Flex container's margins do not collapse with the margins of its content. We can easily change the order of elements on our webpage without even making changes in
